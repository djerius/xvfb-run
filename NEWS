    * command line option --command-kill-after-timeout wasn't implemented

    * Start with xfvb-run from Debian Stretch

    * add --auto-display (concept taken from CentOS7's version) to
      have Xvfb find the next server number. CentOS7's version didn't
      work on CentOS7 (same code worked on CentOS6) because of a
      change in the server or bash or something else...

    * add --server-timeout to timeout if communication with server
      in --auto-display mode takes too long

    * add --command-timeout and --command-kill-after-timeout if
      command takes too long

    * add --version
